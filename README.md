# Computer Networks Assignment 1, Problem 1

## Usage

A run.sh file is provided for convenience.
  * The path to the appropriate pcap file needs to be passed as an argument.
  * It needs to be called from within the same working directory. (ie. the invocation should look like `./run.sh "/path/to/pcap/file.pcap"`)
  * After running the sh file once, make sure to kill the "server" process on your system so that you may run it again.
